# Beetle-Battle
Vriginia Tech Fall Game Jam game

For the game jam of fall 2018, the theme was Projection.
This is the game my team built in 48 hours using Unity named Beetle Battle. 

For this game I did the art, UI, and UX.
All the menus, beetles, and sticks were created using Asesprite.

Beetle Battle is about beetles that project their will upon other beetles.
GOAL: Project your beetle will into all the beetles of the other team.

To play:
You can grab the Build folder and all the necessary pieces are there to play the game.
